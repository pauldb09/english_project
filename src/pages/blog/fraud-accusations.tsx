                                                    The corruption scandal exposed by Amnesty International's report has had a significant impact on our organization. The revelation of financial
                                                    impropriety and misappropriation of funds has damaged our reputation and led to a loss of trust among our stakeholders. Employees within the

                                                    cronyism has also led to a sense of disillusionment among staff members who were passed over for promotions or felt their contributions were
                                                    undervalued. In addition, the lack of accountability highlighted in the report has led to increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies and a need for
                                                    greater transparency and oversight within the organization. As we move forward, it is imperative that we take action to address the issues raised by

                                                    communicate with our stakeholders, working to rebuild the trust that has been lost and engaging in open and transparent communication regarding the
                                                    actions we are taking to address the issues raised by the report. It is our hope that through these measures, we can begin to move forward from this
                                                    difficult situation and continue to work toward our mission of environmental conservation and sustainability.
